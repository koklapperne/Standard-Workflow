This is the textfile of the project.
** topicA **
We are now ready to work on topicA. Here we will just add some text and merge it with develop.
** topicB **
We are now ready to work on topicB. It is important to merge from develop into topicB before starting work.
If this is not done the work done in topicA is not visible in topicB. IPORTANT: this means that this workflow
does not allow for simultanious work on the the same files but only allows sequentiel work.
After one commit and push we wil do some more work on the file commit it and push it.
